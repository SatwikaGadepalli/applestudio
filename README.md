This setup creates a basic Apple Watch Studio-like UI with a main display area for the watch and a customization panel. The customization panel uses tabs to switch between different customization options (case, size, and band).

To make this more interactive and visually appealing, you would need to:

1. Add real images for the watch cases, sizes, and bands.
2. Implement state management to update the watch display based on user selections.
3. Add more detailed styling to match Apple's design aesthetic.
4. Implement animations for smooth transitions between customization options.

These changes will add placeholder images to the customization options and update the main watch display based on the user's selections. Here's a summary of what we've done:

1. Updated the WatchDisplay component to change the image based on the selected options.
2. Modified the CustomizationPanel to include images for each option.
3. Added state management in the main page component to keep track of the user's selections.
4. Passed the selected options to the WatchDisplay component and the selection handler to the CustomizationPanel.


In a real application, you would replace the placeholder images with actual product images. You might also want to add more detailed styling, animations, and possibly 3D renders of the watch to make the experience more immersive and similar to Apple's actual Watch Studio.
